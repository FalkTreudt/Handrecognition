Code for tracking your hand and create XML file to safe data / controll windows volume

HandTrackingModule is a module to get the coordinates of 15 different points of your hand
Most of it isn't made by myself

HandTracking_main uses HandTrackingModule and uses the coordinates of some points to write them into XML in my apache folder, thats used to controll robotic hand on ESP32. Earlier I used it to controll the Windows Sounf Volume (still in the code, but as comment).
could be improved at some points...
